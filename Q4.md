### What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?
Ans:ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several major features and enhancements to JavaScript. Here are some of the key features introduced in ES6:

1-Block-Scoped Declarations:

let and const keywords were introduced to declare block-scoped variables, improving scoping behavior compared to var.

2-Arrow Functions:

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions, with a simplified syntax and lexical this binding.

3-Enhanced Object Literals:

Object literals gained several enhancements, including shorthand syntax for defining methods, computed property names, and property value shorthands.

4-Template Literals:

Template literals allow for more flexible string interpolation, multiline strings, and expression embedding using backticks ( ) and ${}.

5-Destructuring Assignment:

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables, providing a concise way to assign variables.

6-Spread and Rest Operators:

The spread (...) operator allows you to spread elements of an array or object into another array or object, while the rest (...) operator allows you to gather function arguments into an array.

7-Classes:

ES6 introduced the class syntax for defining classes in JavaScript, providing a more familiar and concise way to create objects with constructors and methods.

8-Modules:

Modules were introduced as a standardized way to organize and share JavaScript code between files, using the import and export keywords.

9-Promises:

Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain.

10-Iterators and Generators:

ES6 introduced the concept of iterators and generators, enabling custom iteration behaviors for objects and simplifying the creation of iterable objects.

11-Enhanced Array Operations:

Several new array methods were introduced, such as map(), filter(), find(), findIndex(), some(), every(), and includes(), providing more expressive and functional programming capabilities.

12-Symbols:

Symbols are a new primitive type introduced in ES6, providing a way to create unique and immutable identifiers, often used as object properties.

These are just some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought significant improvements to JavaScript, making the language more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with, and forming the foundation for modern JavaScript development practices. Subsequent ECMAScript versions have continued to add more features and enhancements to the language.
