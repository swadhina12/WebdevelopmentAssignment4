###  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?
Ans:Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a feature in JavaScript that provide an improved way to work with strings, allowing for more flexibility and readability. Template literals are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

Here's an overview of how to use template literals and their key features:

String Interpolation:
Template literals allow you to embed expressions within the string using the ${} syntax. The expressions inside ${} are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string.

```JavaScript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
// Output: My name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
In this example, the variables name and age are interpolated within the template literal, resulting in a string with the corresponding values.

Multiline Strings:
Template literals make it easy to create multiline strings without the need for concatenation or escape characters.

```JavaScript
const message = `This is
a multiline
string.`;

console.log(message);
/*
Output:
This is
a multiline
string.
*/
```

The multiline string in the example is created by simply adding line breaks within the template literal, resulting in a more readable and natural representation.

Expression Evaluation:
Within template literals, expressions can be complex, involving function calls, arithmetic operations, ternary operators, or any valid JavaScript expression.

```JavaScript
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`);
// Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
```

In this case, the expression ${a + b} is evaluated and its result is included in the resulting string.

Nesting Template Literals:
Template literals can be nested within other template literals, allowing for more complex string construction.

```JavaScript
const name = "John";
const message = `Hello, ${`My name is ${name}`}.`;
console.log(message);
// Output: Hello, My name is John.
```
Here, the nested template literal ${name} is enclosed within the outer template literal, resulting in a concatenated string.

Template literals provide a convenient way to work with strings in JavaScript, offering improved readability, easy expression interpolation, multiline support, and the ability to nest templates. They are widely used in modern JavaScript development for string manipulation, generating dynamic content, and creating well-formatted and readable code.
