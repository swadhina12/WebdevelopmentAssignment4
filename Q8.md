### Q8-How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6?
Ans:Destructuring is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and intuitive way. Here's how you can destructure objects and arrays in ES6:

Destructuring Objects:
To destructure an object, you use curly braces {} and provide the variable names that correspond to the object's property names. The variable names are assigned the corresponding property values from the object.

```JavaScript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",
};

const { name, age, city } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(city); // Output: New York
```

In this example, the person object is destructured, and the variables name, age, and city are assigned the corresponding property values from the object.

You can also destructure an object and assign the extracted values to variables with different names by using a colon :.

```JavaScript
const { name: personName, age: personAge } = person;

console.log(personName); // Output: John
console.log(personAge); // Output: 30
```

In this case, the values of name and age properties are assigned to variables personName and personAge, respectively.

Destructuring Arrays:
To destructure an array, you use square brackets [] and provide variable names to extract values from corresponding array positions.

```JavaScript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

const [firstColor, secondColor, thirdColor] = colors;

console.log(firstColor); // Output: red
console.log(secondColor); // Output: green
console.log(thirdColor); // Output: blue
```

In this example, the colors array is destructured, and the variables firstColor, secondColor, and thirdColor are assigned the values from the array in their respective positions.

You can also skip array elements during destructuring by leaving empty slots or using commas.

```JavaScript
const [, , thirdColor] = colors;

console.log(thirdColor); // Output: blue
```

In this case, the first two elements of the colors array are skipped, and only the value at the third position is assigned to thirdColor.

Destructuring can also be used in function parameters to extract values directly.

```JavaScript
function greet({ name, age }) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`);
}

greet(person);
// Output: Hello, John! You are 30 years old.
```

In this example, the greet function expects an object as a parameter. The object is destructured within the function's parameter itself, extracting the name and age properties.

Destructuring in ES6 provides a concise and powerful way to extract values from arrays and objects, making code more readable and expressive, and reducing the need for repetitive assignments.
