### Q1-Explain Hoisting in JavaScript?
Ans:Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are actually defined in the code. This means that you can use variables and call functions before they are declared in your code, and they will still be accessible.

However, it's important to note that hoisting does not actually move the code itself; it's just a conceptual way to understand how JavaScript works during its compilation phase. The code is executed in the same order as it appears in the source file.

Let's take a look at two common scenarios where hoisting occurs: variable hoisting and function hoisting.

Variable Hoisting:
When variables are hoisted, the JavaScript engine moves the variable declarations to the top of their respective scopes. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. Here's an example:

```JavaScript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```
In the above code, even though x is used before it is declared, it doesn't result in an error. During hoisting, the declaration var x is moved to the top, but the assignment x = 5 remains in its original position. Therefore, the first console.log outputs undefined because the variable exists but has not been assigned a value yet. The second console.log outputs 5 as expected.

Function Hoisting:
Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can call a function before it appears in the code. Here's an example:

```JavaScript
hello(); // "Hello!"

function hello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```
In this example, the hello function is called before its declaration. However, since the function declaration is hoisted to the top, the code works fine and outputs "Hello!".

It's important to note that hoisting only applies to function declarations, not function expressions. Function expressions are not hoisted, and you can only use them after they have been defined.

In summary, hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. This allows you to use variables and call functions before they are actually declared in the code, making it easier to organize and structure your JavaScript programs.
