### Q2-Explain Temporal Dead Zone?
Ans:The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when variables declared with let and const are inaccessible and throw a runtime error if accessed before they are initialized. It is a mechanism introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address issues with hoisting and improve JavaScript's behavior.

In JavaScript, variables declared with let and const are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes, similar to variables declared with var. However, unlike var, which is initialized with the value undefined, variables declared with let and const remain uninitialized until their actual declaration point. The TDZ is the temporal period between the start of the scope and the declaration point of a variable, during which accessing the variable will throw a ReferenceError.

Here's an example that demonstrates the Temporal Dead Zone:

```JavaScript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```

In the above code, x is declared using let, but it is accessed before its initialization. This results in a ReferenceError because the variable is in the TDZ. Only after the variable is initialized with the value 5, it can be accessed without any issues.

The Temporal Dead Zone applies to block scopes, such as if statements, for loops, and functions. For example:

```JavaScript
function example() {
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  let y = 10;
  console.log(y); // 10
}
example();
```

In this case, the variable y is declared within the example function. Accessing y before its initialization throws a ReferenceError within the TDZ. Once the variable is initialized, it can be accessed normally.

The introduction of the Temporal Dead Zone with let and const declarations helps prevent accidental usage of variables before they are properly initialized, enhancing code reliability and predictability.

It's worth noting that the TDZ does not apply to variables declared with var. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined, allowing them to be accessed before their actual declaration point. However, it is generally recommended to use let and const for better code quality and to avoid issues related to hoisting and the TDZ.
