###  Whatâ€™s difference between map & forEach?
Ans:The map() and forEach() are both array methods in JavaScript used for iterating over an array and performing operations on its elements. However, they have some differences in terms of their return value and how they handle the resulting array.

Return Value:
map(): The map() method creates a new array by applying a provided callback function to each element of the original array. It returns a new array containing the results of the callback function for each element.

forEach(): The forEach() method does not create a new array. It simply executes a provided callback function once for each element in the array. It does not return any value.

```JavaScript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredMap = numbers.map((num) => num ** 2);
console.log(squaredMap);
// Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

const doubledForEach = numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num * 2));
// Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
console.log(doubledForEach);
// Output: undefined
```

In the above example, map() returns a new array squaredMap with each element squared, while forEach() executes the callback function for each element, but does not produce a new array. The result of forEach() is undefined.

Usage:
map(): The map() method is typically used when you want to transform each element of an array and create a new array with the transformed values. It is useful when you need to maintain the original array intact and derive a new array based on the original array.

forEach(): The forEach() method is used when you want to iterate over each element of an array and perform a specific action for each element. It is commonly used for side effects such as logging, modifying the original array, or executing a function for each element.

```JavaScript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredMap = numbers.map((num) => num ** 2);
console.log(squaredMap);

numbers.forEach((num, index) => {
  numbers[index] = num ** 2;
});
console.log(numbers);
```

In this example, map() is used to create a new array squaredMap with squared values, while forEach() is used to modify the original numbers array directly.

Breaking the Loop:
map(): The map() method iterates through all elements of the array, regardless of the return value of the callback function. It processes each element and creates a new array based on the results of the callback function.

forEach(): The forEach() method always iterates through all elements of the array, executing the callback function for each element. There is no built-in way to break or stop the iteration before reaching the end of the array.

In summary, the main differences between map() and forEach() are that map() returns a new array based on the results of the provided callback function, while forEach() executes a callback function for each element of the array without returning a value. map() is typically used for transforming an array and creating a new array, while forEach() is used for iterating over an array and performing actions for each element.
