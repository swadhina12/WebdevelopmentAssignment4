### Q5-What is the difference between let and const ?
Ans:The main difference between let and const in JavaScript lies in their mutability. Here's a breakdown of the key distinctions:

Variable Assignment:
let allows variable reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned to a new value or reference.
const prohibits variable reassignment: Variables declared with const are read-only and cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. However, it's important to note that const does not make variables immutable. If the variable holds an object or an array, the properties or elements of the object or array can still be modified.

```JavaScript
let x = 5;
x = 10; // Valid reassignment with 'let'

const y = 5;
y = 10; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

In this example, x declared with let can be reassigned a new value, while y declared with const throws a TypeError because reassignment is not allowed.

Initialization:
let requires initialization: Variables declared with let can be declared without an initial value and assigned later.
const requires initialization: Variables declared with const must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration. Otherwise, it will result in a syntax error.

```JavaScript
let x; // Declaration without initialization is valid

const y; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

Here, let x; is a valid declaration without an initial value, whereas const y; throws a syntax error because const requires an initializer.

Block Scope:
Both let and const are block-scoped: Variables declared with both let and const have block-level scope, meaning they are limited to the block in which they are defined (e.g., within an if statement, for loop, or a block denoted by curly braces {}).

```JavaScript
if (true) {
  let z = 5;
  const w = 10;
}

console.log(z); // ReferenceError: z is not defined
console.log(w); // ReferenceError: w is not defined
```

In this example, both z and w are block-scoped variables declared within the if block. Accessing them outside of that block results in a ReferenceError.

Hoisting:
let and const are hoisted: Similar to var, both let and const declarations are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. However, unlike var, they are not initialized and remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration.

```JavaScript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
const y = 10;
```
In this example, both x and y are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes. However, accessing them before their declaration points throws a ReferenceError due to the TDZ.

In summary, let allows variable reassignment and requires initialization, while const disallows variable reassignment and also requires initialization. Both let and const have block scope and are hoisted, but const provides an additional level of immutability by preventing reassignment.
