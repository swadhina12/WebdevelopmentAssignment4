### Q3-Difference between var & let?
Ans:The main difference between var and let in JavaScript lies in their scoping behavior and how they handle variable declarations. Here are the key distinctions:

Scope:
var has function-level scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined, regardless of block boundaries.
let has block-level scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are limited to the block in which they are defined (e.g., within an if statement, for loop, or a block denoted by curly braces {}).

```JavaScript
function example() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5;
    let y = 10;
  }
  
  console.log(x); // 5 (accessible outside the if block)
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (not accessible outside the if block)
}
```
In this example, x is declared with var and is accessible outside the if block due to function-level scoping. However, y is declared with let and is limited to the if block's scope, causing a ReferenceError when accessed outside of it.

Hoisting:
var variables are hoisted: Variable declarations using var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use var variables before they are declared, although they will be initialized with the value undefined.
let variables are not hoisted: Variables declared with let are not hoisted, resulting in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) where accessing them before their declaration point throws a ReferenceError.

```JavaScript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y = 10;
```
In the above code, the first console.log using var outputs undefined because the variable is hoisted, but not yet assigned a value. The second console.log using let throws a ReferenceError since y is in the TDZ and cannot be accessed before its declaration.

Re-declaration:
var allows re-declaration: Variables declared with var can be re-declared within the same scope without any issues. This behavior can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and make code harder to debug.
let does not allow re-declaration: Variables declared with let cannot be re-declared within the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error.

```JavaScript
var x = 5;
var x = 10; // No error, re-declaration of 'x'

let y = 5;
let y = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
```
In this example, re-declaring x with var doesn't cause an error, but it essentially overrides the previous declaration. On the other hand, re-declaring y with let results in a syntax error, preventing unintended redeclaration and potential bugs.

Overall, using let provides block-level scoping, avoids hoisting-related issues, and prevents accidental re-declarations, making it the preferred choice for variable declaration in modern JavaScript development.
